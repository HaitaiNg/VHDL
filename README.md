##### How to compile and execute the source code
Vivado Design Suite by Xilinx 

##### Modules
- Cordic Algorithm: Computes hyperbolic and trigonometric functions using addition, subtraction, bit shifting, and table look up. User provides inputs via keyboard, and results will be returned on the FPGA.
- Tic-Tac-Toe: A Tic-Tac-Toe simulation. User provides inputs via keyboard, and the FPGA will display results on an external monitor.
- Vending Machine: Vending machine simulation (proof of concept). All inputs and outputs occur on the FPGA.
